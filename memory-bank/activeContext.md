# Active Context: Cordova Android Exercises Plugin (2025-04-30)

**Current Focus:** Updating the memory bank to reflect the project's state after a significant time gap. The last active work involved implementing the plugin in Kotlin, adding permission handling, and attempting to resolve build issues (specifically related to `compileSdkVersion`).

**Recent Changes (before memory bank update):**

*   The core plugin logic (`RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.kt`) was implemented to fetch exercise data using Health Connect.
*   A separate activity (`HealthActivityPermissions.kt`) was created to handle the permission request flow.
*   The JavaScript interface (`www/RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.js`) was updated to expose `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData`.
*   `plugin.xml` was configured for Kotlin source files, permissions, and the permissions activity.
*   `android/build.gradle` was updated with dependencies for Health Connect, Kotlin coroutines, and Gson, and configured source sets for Kotlin.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Complete Memory Bank Update:** Create the `progress.md` file.
2.  **Verify Build Configuration:** Re-assess the `android/build.gradle` file, particularly the commented-out sections and the active configuration, to ensure `compileSdkVersion`, `minSdkVersion`, and other settings are correct and compatible with Health Connect and the target Cordova environment. Address the persistent `compileSdkVersion` error reported previously.
3.  **Test Plugin:** Thoroughly test the `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData` functions in a sample Cordova application.
4.  **Refine Error Handling:** Improve error reporting and handling in the Kotlin code.
5.  **Documentation:** Update `README.md` with usage instructions.

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**

*   **Kotlin Implementation:** The project is committed to using Kotlin for the native Android part.
*   **Permissions Flow:** Using a dedicated Activity for permissions is the current approach.
*   **Build Issues:** Resolving the build configuration errors (especially `compileSdkVersion`) is critical. The current `android/build.gradle` seems minimal and might be missing necessary configurations typically found in a Cordova plugin's Gradle file (like applying the `com.android.library` plugin).

**Important Patterns & Preferences:**

*   Use Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous Health Connect operations.
*   Structure data returned to JavaScript as JSON using Gson.
*   Follow standard Cordova plugin structure.

**Learnings & Insights:**

*   Cordova plugin development involving specific Android SDKs like Health Connect can be complex due to build configuration interactions between Cordova, Gradle, and native dependencies.
*   Persistent build errors often point to configuration mismatches or missing setup steps in the host project or the plugin's Gradle files.
*   Directly modifying `android/build.gradle` within the plugin is the standard way to manage dependencies, but care must be taken to ensure compatibility with the Cordova build process.
