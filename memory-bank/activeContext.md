# Active Context: Cordova Health Exercises Plugin (2025-04-30)

**Current Focus:** Troubleshooting iOS HealthKit authorization issues (`.sharingDenied` status despite user granting permissions) and implementing/refining an automated entitlement hook. Android build issues remain paused.

**Recent Changes:**

*   **iOS Implementation & Troubleshooting:**
    *   Updated `plugin.xml` for iOS: Added `HealthKit.framework`, privacy descriptions, Swift source file reference, `cordova-plugin-add-swift-support` dependency, and an `after_prepare` hook definition (`scripts/ios/add_healthkit_entitlement.js`).
    *   Created `src/ios/RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.swift` with initial `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData` methods.
    *   Refined `requestPermissions` to include multiple distance types and added `#available` checks for OS-specific types (`distanceCrossCountrySkiing` for iOS 18.0+, `distanceDownhillSnowSports` for iOS 11.2+).
    *   Added logging to `getExerciseData` to check `authorizationStatus` before querying.
    *   Modified `getExerciseData` authorization check (per user request) to only guard against `.notDetermined`, allowing `.sharingDenied` to proceed (expecting query to fail later).
*   **iOS Entitlement Hook:**
    *   Added `plist` and `xcode` Node modules as dev dependencies to `package.json`.
    *   Created hook script `scripts/ios/add_healthkit_entitlement.js` that:
        *   Modifies/creates the `.entitlements` file to add `com.apple.developer.healthkit`.
        *   Uses the `xcode` module to modify the `.pbxproj` file, setting the `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` build setting to link the entitlements file.
*   **Android:**
    *   Reverted previous changes to `android/build.gradle` and removed commented-out code based on user feedback.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Test iOS Entitlement Hook & Auth:** Build the iOS platform (`cordova build ios` after `npm install` in plugin dir) and verify:
    *   The hook script runs without errors (check build logs).
    *   The HealthKit capability is added and the `.entitlements` file is correctly referenced in the Xcode project (`platforms/ios/`).
    *   Run the app and test if the `sharingDenied` issue is resolved. Observe the detailed auth status logs and query results/errors.
2.  **Verify Provisioning Profile (User):** User to confirm the provisioning profile includes the HealthKit capability.
3.  **Refine iOS Error Handling:** Based on testing, improve error reporting.
4.  **Update Memory Bank:** Update `progress.md`.
5.  **Documentation:** Update `README.md` with usage instructions for both platforms, including notes on hook dependencies and provisioning.
6.  **(Paused)** Revisit Android build issues.

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**

*   **iOS Language/Framework:** Swift / HealthKit.
*   **Automated Entitlement:** Implemented via Cordova hook using `plist` and `xcode` modules.
*   **iOS Authorization Check:** Modified `getExerciseData` check to allow `.sharingDenied` (per user request), understanding the query might fail later. This deviates from standard practice.
*   **Android Build Issues:** Paused.

**Important Patterns & Preferences:**

*   Use Swift for native iOS code.
*   Use Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous Health Connect operations (Android).
*   Use `HKSampleQuery` for fetching HealthKit data (iOS).
*   Structure data returned to JavaScript as JSON.
*   Follow standard Cordova plugin structure.
*   Dispatch HealthKit callbacks to the main thread.
*   Use Cordova hooks for build process modifications where necessary (like entitlements).

**Learnings & Insights:**

*   HealthKit authorization can be tricky. Status reported by `authorizationStatus(for:)` might not immediately match user actions or Settings app state, often due to entitlement or provisioning profile issues.
*   The `success` parameter in `requestAuthorization`'s callback only indicates the process completed, not that specific permissions were granted.
*   Correctly configuring entitlements (`com.apple.developer.healthkit`) and linking the `.entitlements` file via `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` build setting is crucial for HealthKit access.
*   Provisioning profiles must also include the HealthKit capability.
*   Cordova hooks, combined with Node modules like `plist` and `xcode`, can automate modifications to native project files during the build.
