# Active Context: Cordova Health Exercises Plugin (2025-04-30)

**Current Focus:** Troubleshooting iOS HealthKit authorization issues (`.sharingDenied` status despite user granting permissions) and implementing/refining an automated entitlement hook. Android build issues remain paused.

**Recent Changes:**

*   **iOS Implementation & Troubleshooting:**
    *   Updated `plugin.xml` for iOS: Added `HealthKit.framework`, privacy descriptions, Swift source file reference, `cordova-plugin-add-swift-support` dependency, and an `after_prepare` hook definition (`scripts/ios/add_healthkit_entitlement.js`).
    *   Created `src/ios/RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.swift` with initial `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData` methods.
    *   Refined `requestPermissions` to include multiple distance types, basal energy, and added `#available` checks for OS-specific distance types.
    *   Refactored `getExerciseData` and added `fetchSamples` helper to:
        *   Use `HKStatisticsQuery` to calculate sums for active energy, basal energy, and distance (dynamically typed) instead of deprecated `HKWorkout` properties.
        *   Use `HKSampleQuery` for heart rate samples.
        *   Manage multiple async queries per workout using `DispatchGroup`.
        *   Format output JSON as specified by user (including `samples` array).
    *   Modified `getExerciseData` authorization check (per user request) to only guard against `.notDetermined`.
    *   Modified distance sub-query check (per user request) to proceed if status is `.sharingAuthorized` or `.sharingDenied`.
    *   Removed `[weak self]` capture lists from closures (per user change).
    *   Removed explicit thread safety for result aggregation (per user change).
*   **iOS Entitlement Configuration:** Configured HealthKit entitlements directly in `plugin.xml` using `<config-file target="*/Entitlements-*.plist">`. Removed automated hook script and its dependencies.
*   **Android:**
    *   Remains paused. Build configuration issues unresolved.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Test iOS Implementation:** Build the iOS platform (`cordova build ios`) and verify:
        *   The HealthKit capability is correctly applied via `plugin.xml`.
        *   Run the app and test `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData`.
        *   Verify the output JSON format matches the requirement.
        *   Observe behavior related to the modified authorization checks and distance query logic.
        *   Check for potential issues related to removed `[weak self]` or thread safety.
2.  **Verify Provisioning Profile (User):** User to confirm the provisioning profile includes the HealthKit capability.
3.  **Refine iOS Implementation:** Based on testing, fix bugs, improve error handling, and potentially refine distance type querying or thread safety.
4.  **Update Memory Bank:** Update `progress.md`.
5.  **Documentation:** Update `README.md`. **COMPLETED**
6.  **(Paused)** Revisit Android build issues.

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**

*   **iOS Language/Framework:** Swift / HealthKit.
*   **Entitlement Configuration:** Configured directly in `plugin.xml`.
*   **Deprecated Properties:** Replaced usage of deprecated `HKWorkout` properties (`totalEnergyBurned`, `totalDistance`) with `HKStatisticsQuery`.
*   **iOS Authorization Check:** Modified `getExerciseData` core auth check to allow `.sharingDenied` (per user request).
*   **iOS Distance Query Check:** Modified to allow `.sharingAuthorized` or `.sharingDenied` (per user request).
*   **iOS Closure Captures:** `[weak self]` removed from closures (per user change, potential risk).
*   **iOS Thread Safety:** Explicit locking removed for result aggregation (per user change, potential risk).
*   **Android Build Issues:** Paused.

**Important Patterns & Preferences:**

*   Use Swift for native iOS code.
*   Use Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous Health Connect operations (Android).
*   Use `HKSampleQuery` for fetching HealthKit data (iOS).
*   Structure data returned to JavaScript as JSON.
*   Follow standard Cordova plugin structure.
*   Dispatch HealthKit callbacks to the main thread.
*   Use `HKStatisticsQuery` for calculating sums from samples.
*   Use `HKSampleQuery` for fetching individual samples.
*   Use `DispatchGroup` for managing multiple asynchronous queries.
*   Structure data returned to JavaScript as JSON.
*   Follow standard Cordova plugin structure.
*   Dispatch HealthKit callbacks to the main thread.
*   Configure entitlements directly in `plugin.xml`.

**Learnings & Insights:**

*   HealthKit authorization status can be tricky; entitlement and provisioning profile configuration are crucial.
*   Deprecated HealthKit properties should be replaced by calculating statistics from samples.
*   Dynamically querying specific quantity types based on workout activity is needed for accuracy.
*   Omitting `[weak self]` and explicit thread safety in concurrent Swift code carries risks (retain cycles, race conditions).
