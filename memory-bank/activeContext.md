# Active Context: Cordova Android Exercises Plugin (2025-04-30)

**Current Focus:** Implementing the iOS version of the plugin using Swift and Apple's HealthKit framework to mirror the Android functionality (`requestPermissions`, `getExerciseData`). The Android build issues are currently paused.

**Recent Changes:**

*   **iOS Implementation:**
    *   Updated `plugin.xml` to include the `<platform name="ios">` section, linking `HealthKit.framework`, adding privacy usage descriptions (`NSHealthShareUsageDescription`, `NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription`), and specifying the Swift source file (`src/ios/RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.swift`).
    *   Created the main Swift plugin file: `src/ios/RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.swift`.
    *   Implemented the `requestPermissions` method in Swift, handling the HealthKit authorization flow using `healthStore.requestAuthorization`.
    *   Implemented the `getExerciseData` method in Swift, using `HKSampleQuery` to fetch `HKWorkout` data based on start/end dates provided as arguments, and serializing the results to JSON. Added basic error handling and main thread dispatch for callbacks.
*   **Android:**
    *   Reverted previous changes to `android/build.gradle` and removed commented-out code based on user feedback.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Test iOS Plugin:** Thoroughly test the `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData` functions on an iOS device/simulator within a sample Cordova application.
2.  **Refine iOS Error Handling:** Improve error reporting and handling in the Swift code, particularly around edge cases in HealthKit queries and data serialization.
3.  **Update Memory Bank:** Update `progress.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` to reflect the iOS implementation details.
4.  **Documentation:** Update `README.md` with usage instructions for both Android and iOS platforms.
5.  **(Paused)** Revisit Android build issues (`compileSdkVersion`) when focus returns to the Android platform.

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**

*   **iOS Language:** Swift is used for the native iOS implementation.
*   **iOS Framework:** Apple HealthKit is used for accessing health data.
*   **Data Fetching (iOS):** Currently fetching basic `HKWorkout` details. More granular data (e.g., heart rate samples *during* a workout) might require additional, more complex queries if needed later.
*   **Android Build Issues:** Resolution is paused while focusing on iOS. The minimal `android/build.gradle` likely still needs proper configuration for a library plugin.
*   **Kotlin Implementation (Android):** Still the chosen language for the Android part.

**Important Patterns & Preferences:**

*   Use Swift for native iOS code.
*   Use Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous Health Connect operations (Android).
*   Use `HKSampleQuery` for fetching HealthKit data (iOS).
*   Structure data returned to JavaScript as JSON (using Gson for Android, `JSONSerialization` for iOS).
*   Follow standard Cordova plugin structure.
*   Dispatch HealthKit callbacks to the main thread before sending results to Cordova.

**Learnings & Insights:**

*   Cordova plugin development requires platform-specific configurations in `plugin.xml` (e.g., frameworks, Info.plist entries).
*   HealthKit requires explicit user authorization for specific data types. The authorization flow is asynchronous.
*   Fetching HealthKit data involves creating specific query types (e.g., `HKSampleQuery`) with predicates and handling results in asynchronous callbacks.
*   Swift integration in Cordova plugins is straightforward using the `@objc` attribute for exposed methods.
*   Care must be taken with threading when handling asynchronous callbacks from native APIs before calling back to Cordova's JavaScript layer.
