# Active Context: Cordova Health Exercises Plugin (2025-05-06)

**Current Focus:** Added permissions for walking speed and step count on iOS and speed for Android. Committing changes and pushing tag `1.2.2-alt`. Android build issues remain paused.

**Recent Changes:**

*   **iOS Implementation - Swift to Objective-C Conversion:**
    *   Converted the native iOS HealthKit plugin code from Swift (`RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.swift`) to Objective-C (`RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.h` and `RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.m`).
    *   Translated class definition, properties, methods, HealthKit interactions, and helper functions to Objective-C syntax.
    *   Implemented asynchronous operations using Objective-C blocks and `dispatch_group_t`.
    *   Updated `plugin.xml` for iOS to reference `RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.h` and `RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.m` and removed the dependency on `cordova-plugin-add-swift-support`.
*   **iOS Bug Fixing:**
    *   Fixed an error with `HKSampleQuery` initialization in the Objective-C code by changing `completionHandler:` to `resultsHandler:`.
*   **iOS Distance Fallback:**
    *   Implemented a fallback for distance extraction on earlier iOS versions using HKStatisticsQuery.
*   **Tagged Release:**
    *   Created and pushed tag `1.2.2-alt` to include new permissions.
*   **Android:**
    *   Remains paused. Build configuration issues unresolved.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **iOS Testing:** Thoroughly test the Objective-C iOS implementation (including the distance fallback) on different iOS versions.
        *   Verify the HealthKit capability is correctly applied via `plugin.xml`.
        *   Run the app and test `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData`.
        *   Verify the output JSON format matches the requirement.
        *   Confirm that the `HKSampleQuery` initializer error is resolved.
        *   Observe behavior related to the modified authorization checks and distance query logic on different iOS versions.
        *   Check for potential issues related to retain cycles or race conditions with Objective-C blocks.
2.  **Verify Provisioning Profile (User):** User to confirm that the provisioning profile includes the HealthKit capability.
3.  **Refine iOS Implementation:** Based on testing, fix any remaining bugs, improve error handling, and potentially refine distance type querying or thread safety.
4.  **Update Memory Bank:** Update `progress.md`.
5.  **(Paused)** Revisit Android build issues.

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**

*   **iOS Language/Framework:** Objective-C / HealthKit.
*   **Entitlement Configuration:** Configured directly in `plugin.xml`.
*   **Deprecated Properties:** Replaced usage of deprecated `HKWorkout` properties (`totalEnergyBurned`, `totalDistance`) with `HKStatisticsQuery`.
*   **iOS Authorization Check:** Modified `getExerciseData` core auth check to allow `.sharingDenied` (per user request).
*   **iOS Distance Query Check:** Modified to allow `.sharingAuthorized` or `.sharingDenied` (per user request).
*   **iOS Asynchronous Operations:** Using Objective-C blocks and `dispatch_group_t`. Potential retain cycle risk if `__weak` or `__unsafe_unretained` is not used.
*   **iOS Thread Safety:** Explicit locking removed for result aggregation (per user change, potential risk).
*   **Android Build Issues:** Paused.

**Important Patterns & Preferences:**

*   Use Objective-C for native iOS code.
*   Use Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous Health Connect operations (Android).
*   Use `HKSampleQuery` and `HKStatisticsQuery` for fetching HealthKit data (iOS).
*   Structure data returned to JavaScript as JSON.
*   Follow standard Cordova plugin structure.
*   Dispatch HealthKit callbacks to the main thread using `dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{...})`.
*   Use `dispatch_group_t` for managing multiple asynchronous queries (iOS).
*   Configure entitlements directly in `plugin.xml`.

**Learnings & Insights:**

*   Converting between Swift and Objective-C requires careful translation of syntax, API usage, and asynchronous patterns.
*   Objective-C blocks require careful memory management to avoid retain cycles.
*   HealthKit query initializers and parameter names can differ between Swift and Objective-C.
*   HealthKit authorization status and entitlement configuration are crucial for proper plugin functionality.
*   Deprecated HealthKit properties should be replaced by calculating statistics from samples.
*   Dynamically querying specific quantity types based on workout activity is needed for accuracy.
