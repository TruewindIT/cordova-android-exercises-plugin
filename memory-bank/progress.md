# Progress: Cordova Health Exercises Plugin (2025-05-06)

**What Works:**

*   **Core Structure:** Basic plugin structure (`plugin.xml`, `package.json`, JS interface).
*   **JavaScript Interface (`www/`):** Exposes `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData`.
*   **Android (Kotlin):**
    *   Kotlin code exists (`src/android/`) for checking Health Connect availability, requesting permissions (via `HealthActivityPermissions.kt`), fetching `ExerciseSessionRecord` and related data using Health Connect SDK/coroutines, and serializing to JSON (Gson).
    *   `plugin.xml` configured for Android platform (Kotlin sources, permissions, activity, build dependencies via `<framework>`).
    *   `android/build.gradle` declares core dependencies.
*   **iOS (Objective-C):**
    *   The native iOS HealthKit plugin code has been converted from Swift to Objective-C.
    *   `src/ios/RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.h` and `src/ios/RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.m` have been created with the Objective-C implementation.
    *   `plugin.xml` has been updated to reference the Objective-C source files and the dependency on `cordova-plugin-add-swift-support` has been removed.
    *   The `requestPermissions:` method is implemented, including HealthKit authorization and OS version checks.
    *   The `getDistanceTypeForActivityType:` helper method is implemented.
    *   The `fetchSamplesForWorkout:completion:` helper method is implemented, including HealthKit queries (`HKStatisticsQuery`, `HKSampleQuery`), `dispatch_group_t` usage, and data processing.
    *   The `getExerciseData:` method is implemented, including argument parsing, authorization checks, workout querying, calling `fetchSamplesForWorkout:completion:`, waiting for results, aggregating, and serializing to JSON.
    *   A bug with `HKSampleQuery` initialization (`completionHandler:` vs `resultsHandler:`) has been fixed.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

1.  **iOS Testing:** Thoroughly test the Objective-C iOS implementation:
    *   Verify the HealthKit capability is correctly applied via `plugin.xml`.
    *   Run the app and test `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData`.
    *   Verify the output JSON format matches the requirement.
    *   Confirm that the `HKSampleQuery` initializer error is resolved.
    *   Observe behavior related to the modified authorization checks.
    *   Check for runtime errors or unexpected behavior, especially related to potential retain cycles or race conditions with Objective-C blocks.
2.  **iOS Error Handling:** Review and improve error handling in Objective-C code, especially around query failures if permissions are denied.
3.  **iOS Distance Logic:** Potentially refine the dynamic distance type selection in `getDistanceTypeForActivityType:` helper for more workout types if needed.
4.  **(Paused) Android Build Errors:** Resolve the persistent `compileSdkVersion` build error.
5.  **(Paused) Android Testing:** End-to-end testing of Android implementation.
6.  **(Paused) Android Error Handling:** Review and improve error handling in Kotlin code.
7.  **(Paused) Android Data Completeness:** Verify data points fetched from Health Connect.

**Current Status:**
*   **iOS:** Implementation is now in Objective-C, includes the core functionality, a bug fix for the HKSampleQuery initializer, and a fallback for distance extraction on earlier iOS versions. Added permissions for walking speed and step count.
*   **Android:** Implementation exists and now includes permission for speed. Build configuration issues remain paused.
*   **Tagged Release:** Created and pushed tag `1.2.2-alt` to include new permissions.

**Known Issues:**

*   **iOS Authorization Status:** Previous issue where `authorizationStatus(for:)` returned `.sharingDenied` (1) despite Settings. Root cause likely entitlement/provisioning. Needs verification. Behavior with modified auth checks needs testing.
*   **Potential iOS Risks:** Potential retain cycle risk with Objective-C blocks if `__weak` or `__unsafe_unretained` is not used. Removal of explicit thread safety may cause race conditions during result aggregation. Needs monitoring during testing.
*   **Android Build Error:** `compileSdkVersion is not specified`. Needs resolution.
*   **Incomplete `android/build.gradle`:** Needs proper library plugin configuration.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**

*   Switched from Java to Kotlin for Android implementation.
*   Used a dedicated Activity (`HealthActivityPermissions.kt`) for Android permissions.
*   Multiple attempts made to configure `android/build.gradle`.
*   Added iOS platform support using Swift and HealthKit.
*   Converted iOS implementation from Swift to Objective-C (per user request/preference).
*   Replaced deprecated HKWorkout properties with HKStatisticsQuery calculations.
*   Implemented dynamic distance type querying based on workout activity.
*   Incorporated user changes (distance query condition, removal of `[weak self]`, removal of explicit thread safety).
*   Fixed `HKSampleQuery` initializer bug in Objective-C.
*   Implemented distance extraction fallback for earlier iOS versions using HKStatisticsQuery.
