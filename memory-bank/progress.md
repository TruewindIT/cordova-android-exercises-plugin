# Progress: Cordova Health Exercises Plugin (2025-04-30)

**What Works:**

*   **Core Structure:** Basic plugin structure (`plugin.xml`, `package.json`, JS interface).
*   **JavaScript Interface (`www/`):** Exposes `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData`.
*   **Android (Kotlin):**
    *   Kotlin code exists (`src/android/`) for checking Health Connect availability, requesting permissions (via `HealthActivityPermissions.kt`), fetching `ExerciseSessionRecord` and related data using Health Connect SDK/coroutines, and serializing to JSON (Gson).
    *   `plugin.xml` configured for Android platform (Kotlin sources, permissions, activity, build dependencies via `<framework>`).
    *   `android/build.gradle` declares core dependencies.
*   **iOS (Swift):**
    *   `plugin.xml` updated for iOS platform (Swift source, HealthKit framework link, `Info.plist` usage descriptions, `cordova-plugin-add-swift-support` dependency, and HealthKit entitlements configured directly using `<config-file>`).
    *   Swift code exists (`src/ios/RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.swift`) for:
        *   Checking HealthKit availability.
        *   Requesting permissions including basal energy and relevant distance types (with `#available` checks).
        *   Fetching `HKWorkout` data using `HKSampleQuery`.
        *   For each workout, fetch associated samples using `DispatchGroup` and multiple queries:
            *   `HKStatisticsQuery` for active energy sum.
            *   `HKStatisticsQuery` for basal energy sum.
            *   `HKStatisticsQuery` for distance sum (dynamically typed based on activity).
            *   `HKSampleQuery` for heart rate samples.
        *   Calculate total energy/distance from query results (replacing deprecated `HKWorkout` properties).
        *   Format output JSON with nested `samples` array as specified.
        *   Include user modifications: Core auth check allows `.sharingDenied`, distance query proceeds if status is `.sharingDenied` or `.sharingAuthorized`, closures omit `[weak self]`, explicit thread safety for result aggregation removed.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

1.  **iOS Testing:** Thoroughly test the latest iOS implementation:
    *   Verify the HealthKit capability is correctly applied via `plugin.xml`.
    *   Run the app and test `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData`.
    *   Verify the output JSON format matches the requirement.
    *   Observe behavior related to the modified authorization checks and distance query logic.
    *   Check for runtime errors or unexpected behavior, especially related to potential retain cycles or race conditions.
2.  **iOS Error Handling:** Review and improve error handling in Swift code, especially around query failures if permissions are denied.
3.  **iOS Distance Logic:** Potentially refine the dynamic distance type selection in `getDistanceType` helper for more workout types if needed.
4.  **README Documentation:** Create/update comprehensive usage instructions for both platforms, including provisioning profile requirements. **COMPLETED**
5.  **(Paused) Android Build Errors:** Resolve the persistent `compileSdkVersion` build error.
6.  **(Paused) Android Testing:** End-to-end testing of Android implementation.
7.  **(Paused) Android Error Handling:** Review and improve error handling in Kotlin code.
8.  **(Paused) Android Data Completeness:** Verify data points fetched from Health Connect.

**Current Status:**
*   **iOS:** Implementation updated to use statistics queries instead of deprecated properties, configures entitlements directly in `plugin.xml`, and incorporates user modifications to auth checks and code style. Requires testing and verification.
*   **Android:** Implementation exists but is blocked by build configuration issues (currently paused).

**Known Issues:**

*   **iOS Authorization Status:** Previous issue where `authorizationStatus(for:)` returned `.sharingDenied` (1) despite Settings. Root cause likely entitlement/provisioning. Needs verification. Behavior with modified auth checks needs testing.
*   **Potential iOS Risks:** Removal of `[weak self]` may cause retain cycles. Removal of explicit thread safety may cause race conditions during result aggregation. Needs monitoring during testing.
*   **Android Build Error:** `compileSdkVersion is not specified`. Needs resolution.
*   **Incomplete `android/build.gradle`:** Needs proper library plugin configuration.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**

*   Switched from Java to Kotlin for Android implementation.
*   Used a dedicated Activity (`HealthActivityPermissions.kt`) for Android permissions.
*   Multiple attempts made to configure `android/build.gradle`.
*   Added iOS platform support using Swift and HealthKit.
*   Replaced deprecated HKWorkout properties with HKStatisticsQuery calculations.
*   Implemented dynamic distance type querying based on workout activity.
        *   Incorporated user changes (distance query condition, removal of `[weak self]`, removal of explicit thread safety).
