# Progress: Cordova Android Exercises Plugin (2025-04-30)

**What Works:**

*   **Core Structure:** Basic plugin structure (`plugin.xml`, `package.json`, JS interface).
*   **JavaScript Interface (`www/`):** Exposes `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData`.
*   **Android (Kotlin):**
    *   Kotlin code exists (`src/android/`) for checking Health Connect availability, requesting permissions (via `HealthActivityPermissions.kt`), fetching `ExerciseSessionRecord` and related data using Health Connect SDK/coroutines, and serializing to JSON (Gson).
    *   `plugin.xml` configured for Android platform (Kotlin sources, permissions, activity, build dependencies via `<framework>`).
    *   `android/build.gradle` declares core dependencies.
*   **iOS (Swift):**
    *   `plugin.xml` updated for iOS platform (Swift source, HealthKit framework link, `Info.plist` usage descriptions, `cordova-plugin-add-swift-support` dependency, entitlement hook definition).
    *   `package.json` updated with hook dependencies (`plist`, `xcode`).
    *   Hook script (`scripts/ios/add_healthkit_entitlement.js`) created to automate adding HealthKit entitlement and linking it in `.pbxproj`.
    *   Swift code exists (`src/ios/RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.swift`) for:
        *   Checking HealthKit availability.
        *   Requesting permissions using `healthStore.requestAuthorization` (includes `#available` checks for specific distance types).
        *   Fetching `HKWorkout` data using `HKSampleQuery` based on date range arguments.
        *   Authorization check modified to allow `.sharingDenied` status (per user request).
        *   Serializing fetched data to JSON using `JSONSerialization`.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

1.  **iOS Hook & Auth Testing:** Test the `after_prepare` hook script runs correctly during build and successfully configures the entitlement. Verify if this resolves the `.sharingDenied` status issue when running the app. Test the behavior of `getExerciseData` with the modified auth check.
2.  **iOS Error Handling:** Review and improve error handling in Swift code, especially around query failures if permissions are denied.
3.  **iOS Data Completeness:** Verify if all desired basic `HKWorkout` data points are fetched and returned correctly. Decide if more granular data is needed.
4.  **README Documentation:** Create/update comprehensive usage instructions for both platforms, including hook dependency installation and provisioning profile requirements.
5.  **(Paused) Android Build Errors:** Resolve the persistent `compileSdkVersion` build error.
6.  **(Paused) Android Testing:** End-to-end testing of Android implementation.
7.  **(Paused) Android Error Handling:** Review and improve error handling in Kotlin code.
8.  **(Paused) Android Data Completeness:** Verify data points fetched from Health Connect.

**Current Status:**
*   **iOS:** Core logic implemented, including automated entitlement hook and modified auth check. Requires testing and verification, particularly regarding the persistent authorization issue.
*   **Android:** Implementation exists but is blocked by build configuration issues (currently paused).

**Known Issues:**

*   **iOS Authorization Status:** Persistent issue where `authorizationStatus(for:)` returns `.sharingDenied` (1) even when user reports permissions are granted in Settings. Investigation points towards entitlement/provisioning profile configuration. Hook script implemented as potential fix.
*   **Android Build Error:** `compileSdkVersion is not specified. Please add it to build.gradle`. Root cause needs identification (likely incomplete `android/build.gradle`).
*   **Incomplete `android/build.gradle`:** Needs proper library plugin configuration.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**

*   Switched from Java to Kotlin for Android implementation.
*   Used a dedicated Activity (`HealthActivityPermissions.kt`) for Android permissions.
*   Multiple attempts made to configure `android/build.gradle`.
*   Added iOS platform support using Swift and HealthKit.
*   **Implemented automated iOS entitlement configuration via Cordova hook.**
*   **Modified iOS authorization check logic in `getExerciseData` (per user request) to allow `.sharingDenied` status.**
