# Progress: Cordova Android Exercises Plugin (2025-04-30)

**What Works:**

*   Basic plugin structure is in place (`plugin.xml`, `package.json`, JS interface, Kotlin source files).
*   Kotlin code exists for:
    *   Checking Health Connect availability.
    *   Requesting necessary permissions via a dedicated Activity.
    *   Fetching `ExerciseSessionRecord` and related data (distance, calories, heart rate) using the Health Connect SDK and Kotlin coroutines.
    *   Serializing fetched data to JSON using Gson.
*   JavaScript interface (`www/RequestExercisePermissionsPlugin.js`) exposes `requestPermissions` and `getExerciseData`.
*   `plugin.xml` declares necessary permissions and configures the Kotlin source files and permissions activity.
*   `android/build.gradle` declares core dependencies.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

1.  **Resolve Build Errors:** The most critical blocking issue is the persistent build error related to `compileSdkVersion` not being specified, despite attempts to configure it in `android/build.gradle`. This needs thorough investigation and resolution. The current `android/build.gradle` might be incomplete for a library plugin.
2.  **Testing:** The plugin has not been successfully built or tested in a real Cordova application due to the build errors. End-to-end testing of both permission requests and data fetching is required.
3.  **Error Handling:** The error handling in the Kotlin code, especially around Health Connect API calls and coroutine exceptions, needs review and potential improvement.
4.  **Data Completeness:** Verify if all desired data points from `ExerciseSessionRecord` and related records are being fetched and returned correctly.
5.  **README Documentation:** Create comprehensive usage instructions in `README.md`.

**Current Status:** Blocked by build configuration issues. The core logic is mostly implemented in Kotlin, but cannot be verified until the plugin can be successfully compiled and installed within a Cordova project.

**Known Issues:**

*   **Build Error:** `compileSdkVersion is not specified. Please add it to build.gradle`. This error persisted despite adding `compileSdkVersion` to `android/build.gradle`. The root cause needs identification (e.g., incorrect Gradle file structure, conflicts with host project, missing plugin application in `build.gradle`).
*   **Incomplete `android/build.gradle`:** The current `android/build.gradle` only defines dependencies and source sets. It likely needs to apply the `com.android.library` and `kotlin-android` plugins and define a complete `android { ... }` block with `namespace`, `minSdkVersion`, `compileSdkVersion`, etc., appropriate for an Android library module. The commented-out sections hint at previous attempts.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**

*   The project initially started with a Java implementation but switched to Kotlin to potentially leverage better SDK compatibility and coroutine support.
*   Permission handling evolved to use a dedicated Android Activity (`HealthActivityPermissions.kt`) for a cleaner flow.
*   Multiple attempts were made to configure `build.gradle` to resolve build errors, including adding Kotlin support and `compileSdkVersion`.
